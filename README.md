# espusb-macOS
I managed to get cnlohr's espusb built on my macOS 10.14 machine and thought I would share my success.

Not really trying to provide a whole lot of support for this because it was pretty black magic but will do my best to help where possible.

## How to use

Just clone this repo and follow the instructions for building https://github.com/cnlohr/espusb . When setting your paths in `user.cfg` point to the directories in this repo and cross your fingers.
